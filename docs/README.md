## Quick Start

Before starting, please follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll`, and `Bundler`. In addition, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is also required to be installed.

### Step 1. Creating a New Site

Create a new repository from the [**Chirpy Starter**](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate) and name it `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`, where `GH_USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

### Step 2. Installing Dependencies

Before running for the first time, go to the root directory of your site, and install dependencies as follows:

```console
$ bundle
```

### Step 3. Running Local Server

Run the following command in the root directory of the site:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll s
```

Or run with Docker:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm \
    --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
    -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll serve
```

After a while, navigate to the site at <http://localhost:4000>.
